<h1> Capture The Flag! </h1>

<p>  this project was originally going to be a some chinese based stratego game, 

but i realized it was too much for me to handle so it was scoped down to a simpler stratego game,

and that was scoped down again into the current MVP you are about to experience here.

im going to call it capture the flag,

original idea, any clash of similarities are purely coincidental. </p>

<h2> Screenshots </h2>

<p> when loading up the page you will see a 4x4 board </p>
<img src="img/screenshot1.png">

<p> at this point player1 who is BLUE will place their pieces on the board, anywhere you like </p>
<ul> in the order of: 
  <li> pawn </li>
  <li> pawn </li>
  <li> pawn </li>
  <li> flag </li>
</ul>
<p> then the second player which will be RED will place their pieces, again, anywhere you like.
    after both players have placed each of their four pieces, the game can start</p>
<img src="img/screenshot2.png">
<p> again blue will move first, click on a pawn and click on an empty tile. 

you cant run into your own flag,

you cant run into your own pawns,

and you cant run into your opponent's pawns, make love not war

the only thing you can run into is the opponent flag </p>

<p> each player will take turns moving their pieces, and try to block eachother and take opponent's flag to win </p>
<img src="img/screenshot3.png">

<p> should be pretty obvious when someone wins, and you can reset the board to play again, not sure why you want to though </p>
