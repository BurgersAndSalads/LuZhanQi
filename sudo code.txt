1. Game setup
    1.1 the board
    track board state using 2D array
        a) soldier stations (node)
            these are stations where the pieces will be landing on, 
            upon initial setup, and as the game progress,
            the pieces will be able to land on these stations as they move.
            
            a.1) some stations have special placement rules upon game setup
        
        b) camp (node)
            safe space for pieces to land on,
            pieces cannot be placed here upon initial setup
            opponent pieces cannot attack this node for any reason

        c) headquarters (node)
            functionally this is the same as a soldier station,
            only FLAG piece can be placed here upon setup
            pieces placed here cannot move

        d) nomans land, immpassible terrain,
            these are optional to add into the game, 
            serves no purpse other than visual to divide player sides
            a large space in between will serve the same purpose

        e) roads (line)
            pieces can use roads to travel between nodes if they are connected
            players can only move a single pieces over a single segment of a road per turn
        
        f) rail roads (line)
            pieces can travel between nodes if connected via rail roads
            players can travel in a straight line passing any number of nodes to the final destination
            as long as the path is not obstructed by any other pieces
            (they will attack the node they land on if it is an opponent)

    1.2 the pieces, piece name are not final
        the pieces are ordered from highest power to lowest from 1 being most powerful
        amount means how many pices of this given name will the player control in a single game

        name                rank    amount
        Field Marshall      2       1
        General             3       1
        Lieutenant General  4       2
        Brigadier           5       2
        Colonel             6       2
        Major               7       2
        Captain             8       3
        Platoon Commander   9       3
        Engineer            10      3
        Grenade             0       2
        Landmine            1       3
        Flag                11      1

        special notes
        a) the engineer being the weakest piece, is the only pice that can disable landmines
        the engineer can attack the landmine and survive
        the engineer can travel to their destination using rail roads passing any number of nodes
        as long as they are connected by raild roads, and does not have to be a straight line
        
        b) grenades can move like any other piece, and is able to attack anything and destroy it
        the grenade itself will also be destroyed in the process

        c) landmine functions similarly to grenades, other than 
        it cannot move after being placed during setup
        it will only be removed by the opponent engineer and does not kill the engineer
        it can only be placed on the last 2 rows of the player base

        d) capturing the flag is the goal and winning condition of the players
        flag can not move, 
        flag can only be placed inside one of the headquarters

        e) when the Field Marshall is killed, the flag reveals its location



2. Game flow

    board renders
    each player will be able to place their pieces from their own pool of pieces following the rules
    confirm placement, maybe add feature to change placements, swap places etc. maybe add a timer for setup phase
    game start when each player is ready
    
    {
    2 players, take turns, move pieces one at a time, following the rules
    one player will direct their own piece to any available node
        an available node will be a) a node occupied by an opponent piece
                                  b) an empty node
    when a piece "collides" (attacking) with an opponent piece (it is illegal to attack yourself!)
    game will compare the two pieces rank, higher power piece wins and destroyes the weaker piece and occupy the node
    tie will anilate both pieces
    }

    above process is the general game loop

    game will end when a winner is determined
    the winner is determined when a flag is caputured ("destroyed")

3. other features

concede button
turn timers
reset board
turn indicator
move indicator
implement sound when moving through nodes
sound for combat
other misc sounds
scored keeping (its a friendly war game between friendly friends , keep your own rivalry between yourselves! )


4. AI MAYBE, who knows, maybe too complicated, or the dumbest AI in the world


anything with a large grid, think about the inital data structure, how to manage the grid
